# THE NUMBER GAME!
#
# This program asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 10
# The user is given 5 chances to guess the number
# If the guess is too low, then print "Too low!".
# If the guess is too high, then print "Too high!".
# If the guess is correct, then print "NAILED IT!!!". The program must then exit immediately.
# If the user does not guess the number after 5 guesses, then print "You lose! I win! Womp womp!‚Äù
